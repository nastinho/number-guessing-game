# number-guessing-game
Initially it was an exercise from MDN's JS tutorial, but I wanted to modify the game a bit

In the original version the user is supposed to guess the number from 1 to 100 in 10 turns. Actually, there is a mistake in my code, cause there are 15 turns given.

After completing the exercise I thought it would be nice to extend the number range to 1000 and increase the amount of attempts. I also added the countdown of attempts so that the user sees how many of them he has left.
